# Floating_Point_ALU
IEEE754 Single precision FLoating Point ALU

## Introduction
ALU is the fundamental block of any proccessor. This ALU has high counting power comparing to normal ALU that we have implemented in risc, it can be replaced with our ALU in risc proccessor making it even stronger

## Functions in ALU
- [Addition](https://github.com/Sairamakula1999/Floating_Point_ALU/blob/main/README.md#Addition)
- [Subtraction](https://github.com/Sairamakula1999/Floating_Point_ALU/blob/main/README.md#Subtraction)
- [Multiplication](https://github.com/Sairamakula1999/Floating_Point_ALU/blob/main/README.md#Multiplication)
- [Division](https://github.com/Sairamakula1999/Floating_Point_ALU/blob/main/README.md#Division)
