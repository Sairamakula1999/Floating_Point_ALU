# Floating_Point_ALU
IEEE754 Single precision FLoating Point ALU

## Introduction
ALU is the fundamental block of any proccessor. This ALU has high counting power comparing to normal ALU that we have implemented in risc, it can be replaced with our ALU in risc proccessor making it even stronger

## Functions in ALU
- [Addition](https://github.com/Sairamakula1999/Floating_Point_ALU/blob/main/README.md#Addition/Subtraction)
- [Subtraction](https://github.com/Sairamakula1999/Floating_Point_ALU/blob/main/README.md#Addition/Subtraction)
- [Multiplication](https://github.com/Sairamakula1999/Floating_Point_ALU/blob/main/README.md#Multiplication)
- [Division](https://github.com/Sairamakula1999/Floating_Point_ALU/blob/main/README.md#Division)

## Addition/Subtraction
Firstly one needs to see if Exponent is matched if not match it with the highest one. After that based on signs on inputs A & B, one needs  In this we have used carry look ahead adder for addition.

## 
We have implemented following circuit in design using flow as mentioned below

## Multiplication
We have implemented following circuit in design using flow as mentioned below

## Division
We have implemented following circuit in design using flow as mentioned below
